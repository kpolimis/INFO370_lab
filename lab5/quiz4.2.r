#  2.  What is the probability of winning a lottery that requires you to pick 6 numbers 
#      from 1-49 (1 and 49 are included)?  The 6 numbers are unique so you can't pick the 
#      same number twice.    What is the probability of getting at least 3 of them right?  
#   (a)  Simulate the result and provide figures.  
#   (b)  Provide a histogram of successful numbers for all scenarios 
#        (at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 numbers correct).
